The `SDHCAL` is a stainless steel hadronic sampling calorimeter made with glass resistive plate chambers (`GRPC`) with embedded readout electronics as sensitive medium it is the first technological prototype of a particle flow algorithm (`PFA`) oriented calorimeter developped within the `CALICE` collaboration.

The `SDHCAL` has been designed for the `ILD` detector of the International Linear Collider project (`ILC`).  For `ILD`, an ingenious mechanical structure avoiding
cracks has been designed. This design implies variable length for the sensitive medium with a maximum size of 0.9x3m^2. The challenges for this design are to obtain GRPC response homogeneity for large area,  an active detector with a thickness of only a few mm including the embedded low power consumption electronics and all the services on one side of the detector.

A technological prototype meeting all the above challenges has been conceived as a demonstrator. It is made with a stainless steel selfMsupporting structure able to hold up to 50 `GRPC` cassettes. A cassette is 11mm thick and is a steel cover containing the GRPC and the embedded electronics.
